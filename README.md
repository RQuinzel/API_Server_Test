# API_Server_Test
I'm trying to see how this will best be started, so sorry if it sucks atm. 

Let's try not to work in master when making changes. 

This is the bare bones, I will try to edit it and make it easier to add API's tonight. For now though you can clone it and play around. If anyone knows how to start, then go for it!
